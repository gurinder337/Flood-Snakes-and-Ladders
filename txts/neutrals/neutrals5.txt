Well done, you listened to the children and your family made a flood plan…
Congratulations, you signed up for the EA flood warnings.
At school you and your friends built a model of a river in a box!
Great, your teachers received training about flooding and what it’s like for families to go through the hard work of recovery.
Good news - your school makes a plan which includes finding out which children have been flooded so they can join support groups. 
Break through - your insurance company visits and gives you and your sister a flood pack they’ve made for children.
Great, you’ve persuaded your aunt to join the local Flood Action Group which is looking at building plans in your area.
